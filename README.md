# Learning AI Agent Development

This repository contains code examples and exercises for learning AI Agent development, following a structured plan from basics to advanced topics.

## Phase 1: Foundations (Stateless LLM & Context)

*   `01-hello-world.js`: Demonstrates the stateless nature of LLMs. Each API call is independent.
*   `02-memory-loop.js`: Implements a simple chat loop by manually managing the conversation history (Context Window).

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
4.  Run the examples: `node 01-hello-world.js`.
